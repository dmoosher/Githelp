BASIC COMMANDS

git init        // initializes a dir as a git repo

git add .       // adds all files to the git repos except those in .gitignore
                // Will not add an empty directory.

git status      // Shows status of individual files as untracked, tracked but not staged,
                // and tracked and staged.

git log         // history of commits
git log -2      // only last two
git log -p      // shows diffs
git log -graph

git commit --amend       // Allows you to "amend" or correct last commit by adding any newly staged
                        // files to the last commit instead of creating a new one.

git reset HEAD wrong_file // Removes a file from staging area so that it isn't in the next commit.

git checkout -- undo_file // Returns a file to state of last commit (undoes most recent edits).
                            // ** Danger ** - deprecated as of 2.23.0

git restore undo_file //    Sames as above - newer way to revert file to previous version.

git restore --staged undo_file // unstages file so that you can revert with git restore.

git ls-files        // Show files currently being tracked.
